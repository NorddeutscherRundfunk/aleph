# 1. Create a Timeline

### Background

A timeline in Aleph is always based on a collection of data. If you haven't uploaded a collection yourself or haven't been invited to a collection, you cannot create a timeline. See [Aleph's documentation](https://docs.alephdata.org/) for how to get startet, upload data into Aleph and share that data with others.

The reason behind this document-centered approach: Every element in a timeline needs proof that the event has taken place. Thus, once you're ready to publish, legal personal can vet every step in your documentation. In case you don't have a hard-copy of this event, but know from this, e.g. via at least two independent sources, you can create a memo, upload this into Aleph and then create a timeline event from it. Sounds tedious at first, but in the end you'll be grateful.

### Starting a Timeline

Timelines are part of a collection, since they are an object in Aleph like any other document.

Depending on where you are in the Aleph structure, there are two scenarios for creating a new timeline:

##### a) Starting Within a Collection

Click the Timeline button in the top tabs menu, fill in name and description text, save timeline.

##### b) Starting Without a Collection.

Click the Timeline button in the left tabs menu, fill in name and description text, choose collection in the drop down menu.


# 2. Timeline User Management

Aleph in general and timelines specifically are based on the concepts of collaboration and privacy: The power is given to the user, the owner of a collection where a timeline is located in decides what users are able to see a timeline. Also, a collection user can decide who has reading and writing rights for the timeline. 

### Invite Users to a Collection

Go to "Personal datasets", choose a dataset, click on the share button, search for a user name in the "Choose a user" search box, save changes.

### Manage User Access Rights

Go to "Personal datasets", choose a dataset, click on the share button, search and pick a user, check or uncheck "view" and "edit" boxes in the menu, save changes.

### Timelines Containing Entries from Multiple Collections

Since Aleph is about collaboration, too, users have access to different data collections that may contain proof of a certain timeline event. Users can create all documents as proof for all timelines they have access to. If a collaborator has access to a collection containing a timeline but no access to every single document from other collections that functions as proof for a specific event in the timeline, the user can still see the timeline entry but not the document behind it.
